# AI Algorithms
Implementing some basic ML Algorithms with minimal use of libraries and a focus on bilding from scract which include:
Note: These codes are designed to work on Google Colab
1) Naive Bayes Classifier (with smoothing): Kaggle Titanic Dataset
2) K-Means Clustering with Euclidean Distance: Sklearn Iris Flower Dataset
3) Multilayer Perceptron with One-hot encoding: MINST Dataset
4) CNN: Cifar Dataset

Special Projects:

1) KNN Algorithm, with the following features:
Normaliztion: Minmax and Z-score
Distance: Euclidean and Manhattan
Prediction: Weighted Average and Distance Base
Error Metrics: MAE, MSE, MAPE
D-Fold Cross Validation

2) Multi Layer Perceptron:
Predicting context words given a text using the cbow and skigpram approaches both
